# RockVsMine-Prediction
This project classifies underwater objects as rock or water using sonar wave data. It applies machine learning algorithms to analyze sonar signals and make predictions. The dataset is preprocessed and modeled using scikit-learn with Python. Helps demonstrate real-world applications of ML in underwater detection systems
